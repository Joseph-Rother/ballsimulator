# Ball Blaster

Ball Blaster is a small arcade game built with **Pygame**. You control a blue
ball that can move around the screen and shoot bullets to destroy incoming
enemy squares. As you score points, the game gets faster and more challenging.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Pygame (``pip install pygame``)

## Running the Game

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Gameplay

* Move with the **arrow keys** or **WASD**.
* Shoot bullets with the **Space** key.
* Avoid colliding with enemies; you have three lives.
* Score points by shooting enemies. Every 10 points increases the level and the
enemy spawn rate.
